Bioplib - a high quality programming library for protein bioinformatics.
==============

Python interface based on bioplib.
--------------

**Bioplib** is a programming library, written in the C programming language, for
handling bioinformatics data â€“ primarily protein structures, but also sequence data.

The library has equivalents for other programming languages such as Python (BioPython)
and Perl (BioPerl) and another C library and tool-set (EMBOSS) is also available.
However, the focus of all these other libraries is on protein and DNA sequence rather
than structure. Conversely, **Bioplib** is a very comprehensive library for handling
protein structure, with some support for protein and DNA sequences. The fact that the
code is implemented in C means that it is ideal for more complex and CPU-intensive
tasks since C (unlike Perl and Python) is a compiled language.
